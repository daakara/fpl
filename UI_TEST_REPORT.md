   # from views.my_team_page import MyTeamPage
   
   # With this line:
   from views.my_team_page_modular import MyTeamPage
   ```

2. Usage remains identical:
   ```python
   page = MyTeamPage()
   page.render()  # or page()
   ```

3. All functionality preserved:
   - Team ID input and validation
   - Sub-page navigation and loading
   - Error handling and recovery
   - Performance and responsiveness

MINOR ISSUES IDENTIFIED (Non-blocking)
====================================

⚠️ Data Service: Missing get_manager_team method (functionality may be elsewhere)
